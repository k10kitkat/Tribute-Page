  <p id=tribute-info> Gary Fischer became Henchman 21, when he was abducted by The Monarch's henchman mistakenly during a class trip. The henchman were supposed to take the diplomat that Gary was meeting, but since Gary was a "big kid", he was taken instead. When The Monarch instructed them to kill Gary, they spared his life instead, and thus he became Henchman 21. <a id=tribute-link target="_blank" href="https://venturebrothers.fandom.com/wiki/Henchman_21"> For more information about Henchman 21, see this link.</a></p>
